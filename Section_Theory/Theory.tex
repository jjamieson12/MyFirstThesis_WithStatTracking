This section will cover an introduction to the standard model of particle physics and how the top-quark fits into this model. 

To show something of where we will get to here is an example figure of a leading order \ljets \ttbar decay:

\section{The Standard Model}
\label{sec::TheorySM}
The Standard model of particle physics is alright I guess

\section{The Top Quark}
\label{sec::TheoryTopQuark}
Top-Quarks are pretty top however
